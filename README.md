Source code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZEeHyhC6GUyDuoHZKH660CpBVd3QpbH_?usp=sharing

This project implements Sign Language Alphabet Detection using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The model is trained to recognize hand gestures representing alphabets in sign language.

Features:
Utilizes YOLOv8 for real-time sign language detection.
Detects and recognizes hand gestures representing alphabets.
Supports dataset preparation, training, and inference.
Uses Python, OpenCV, and Ultralytics YOLOv8 for implementation.

Technologies Used:
Python
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
OpenCV
Machine Learning & Deep Learning

Usage:
Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
Run the training script to train the YOLOv8 model on the sign language dataset.
Use the inference script to detect and recognize hand gestures.
